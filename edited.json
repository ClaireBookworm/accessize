Finally, it describes what it means to be accessibility supported, since only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies can be relied upon for conformance. Understanding Conformance includes further explanation of the accessibility-supported concept.. . 5.1 Interpreting Normative Requirements>  . The main content of WCAG 2.1 is normative and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as \"non-normative\", diagrams, examples, and notes are informative (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.. The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, NOT RECOMMENDED, RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].. . . 5.2 Conformance Requirements>  . In order for a Web page to conform to WCAG 2.1, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:. . 5.2.1 Conformance Level>  . One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.. . For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the Web page. satisfies all the Level A Success Criteria, or a conforming alternate version is provided.. For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.. For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.. . NoteAlthough conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.. NoteIt is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.. . . 5.2.2 Full pages>  . Conformance (and conformance level) is for full Web page(s) only, and cannot be achieved if part of a Web page is excluded.. NoteFor the purpose of determining conformance, alternatives to part of a page's content are considered part of the page when the alternatives can be obtained directly from the page, e.g., a long description or an alternative presentation of a video.. NoteAuthors of Web pages that cannot conform due to content outside of the author's control may consider a Statement of Partial Conformance.. NoteNew A full page includes each variation of the page that is automatically presented by the page for various screen sizes (e.g. variations in a responsive Web page). Each of these variations needs to conform (or needs to have a conforming alternate version) in order for the entire page to conform.. . . 5.2.3 Complete processes>  . When a Web page is one of a series of Web pages presenting a process (i.e., a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity), all Web pages in the process conform at the specified level or better. (Conformance is not possible at a particular level if any page in the process does not conform at that level or better.). An online store has a series of pages that are used to select and purchase products. All pages in the series from start to finish (checkout) conform in order for any page that is part of the process to conform.. . . 5.2.4 Only Accessibility-Supported Ways of Using Technologies>  . Only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies are relied upon to satisfy the success criteria. Any information or functionality that is provided in a way that is not accessibility supported is also available in a way that is accessibility supported. (See Understanding accessibility support.). . . 5.2.5 Non-Interference>  . If  technologies  are used in a way that is not accessibility supported, or if they are used in a non-conforming way, then they do not block the ability of users to access the rest of the page. In addition, the Web page as a whole continues to meet the conformance requirements under each of the following conditions:. . when any technology that is not relied upon is turned on in a user agent,. when any technology that is not relied upon is turned off in a user agent, and. when any technology that is not relied upon is not supported by a user agent. . In addition, the following success criteria apply to all content on the page, including content that is not otherwise relied upon to meet conformance, because failure to meet them could interfere with any use of the page:. . 1.4.2 - Audio Control,. 2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap,. 2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below Threshold, and. 2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide.. . NoteIf a page cannot conform (for example, a conformance test page or an example page), it cannot be included in the scope of conformance or in a conformance claim.. For more information, including examples, see Understanding Conformance Requirements.. . . . 5.3 Conformance Claims (Optional) >  . Conformance is defined only for Web pages. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one page, a series of pages, or multiple related Web pages.. . 5.3.1 Required Components of a Conformance Claim>  . Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 2.1 without making a claim. However, if a conformance claim is made, then the conformance claim must include the following information:. . Date of the claim. Guidelines title, version and URI  \"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 at https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\" In WCAG 2.0 this was a dated URI, which may need to be adjusted when this becomes a Rec.. Conformance level satisfied: (Level A, AA or AAA). . A concise description of the Web pages, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including whether subdomains are included in the claim.. NoteThe Web pages may be described by list or by an expression that describes all of the URIs included in the claim.. NoteWeb-based products that do not have a URI prior to installation on the customer's Web site may have a statement that the product would conform when installed.. . A list of the . Web content technologies. relied upon.. . NoteIf a conformance logo is used, it would constitute a claim and must be accompanied by the required components of a conformance claim listed above.. . . 5.3.2 Optional Components of a Conformance Claim >  . In addition to the required components of a conformance claim above, consider providing additional information to assist users. Recommended additional information includes:. . A list of success criteria beyond the level of conformance claimed that have been met. This information should be provided in a form that users can use, preferably machine-readable metadata.. A list of the specific technologies that are \" used but not relied upon.\". A list of user agents, including assistive technologies that were used to test the content.. A list of specific accessibility characteristics of the content, provided in machine-readable metadata.. Information about any additional steps taken that go beyond the success criteria to enhance accessibility.. A machine-readable metadata version of the list of specific technologies that are relied upon.. A machine-readable metadata version of the conformance claim.. . NoteRefer to Understanding Conformance Claims for more information and example conformance claims.. NoteRefer to Understanding Metadata for more information about the use of metadata in conformance claims.. . . . 5.4 Statement of Partial Conformance - Third Party Content>  . Sometimes, Web pages are created that will later have additional content added to them. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.. In these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:. . . A determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;. OR. . . A \"statement of partial conformance\" may be made that the page does not conform, but could conform if certain parts were removed. The form of that statement would be, \"This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.1 at level X if the following parts from uncontrolled sources were removed.\" In addition, the following would also be true of uncontrolled content that is described in the statement of partial conformance:. . It is not content that is under the author's control.. It is described in a way that users can identify (e.g., they cannot be described as \"all parts that we do not control\" unless they are clearly marked as such.). . . . . . 5.5 Statement of Partial Conformance - Language>  . A \"statement of partial conformance due to language\" may be made when the page does not conform, but would conform if accessibility support existed for (all of) the language(s) used on the page. The form of that statement would be, \"This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.1 at level X if accessibility support existed for the following language(s):\". . ",

NoteThe distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute..       Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities..       The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences.       that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies.       target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance.       provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs.       of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality.       to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing.       markup into identifiable bundles..    . Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include.       the following:.    . . screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with.          visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing,.          color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability.          of rendered text and images;.       . screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information.          through synthesized speech or braille;.       . text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and.          learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;.       . speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;. alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities.          to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single.          switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);.       . alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities.          to simulate mouse pointing and button activations..       . . . audio. . the technology of sound reproduction.

NoteA Turing test is any system of tests designed to differentiate a human from a computer..       It is named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing. The term was coined by researchers.       at Carnegie Mellon University..    . . captions. . synchronized visual and/or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content.    .

NoteClosed Captions are equivalents that can be turned on and off with some players.. NoteOpen Captions are any captions that cannot be turned off. For example, if the captions.       are visual equivalent images of text embedded in video..    . NoteCaptions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.. NoteIn some countries, captions are called subtitles.. NoteAudio descriptions can be, but do not need to be, captioned since they are descriptions of information.       that is already presented visually..    . . changes of context. . major changes in the content of the Web page that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view.       the entire page simultaneously.    . Changes in context include changes of:. . user agent;.       . viewport;.       . focus;. content that changes the meaning of the Web page. . . NoteA change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as.       an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the.       context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus)..    . Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including.       anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly.       re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context..    . . conformance. . satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification. . conforming alternate version. . version that. . conforms at the designated level, and. provides all of the same information and functionality in the same human language, and.       . is as up to date as the non-conforming content, and. . for which at least one of the following is true:. . the conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an accessibility-supported. mechanism, or.             . the non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version, or. the non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides.                a mechanism to reach the conforming version.             . . . . NoteIn this definition, \"can only be reached\" means that there is some mechanism, such.       as a conditional redirect, that prevents a user from \"reaching\" (loading) the non-conforming.       page unless the user had just come from the conforming version..    . NoteThe alternate version does not need to be matched page for page with the original.       (e.g., the conforming alternate version may consist of multiple pages)..    . NoteIf multiple language versions are available, then conforming alternate versions are.       required for each language offered..    . NoteAlternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments.       or user groups. Each version should be as conformant as possible. One version would.       need to be fully conformant in order to meet conformance requirement 1..    . NoteThe conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance,.       or even on the same Web site, as long as it is as freely available as the non-conforming.       version..    . NoteAlternate versions should not be confused with supplementary content, which support the original page and enhance comprehension..    . NoteSetting user preferences within the content to produce a conforming version is an.       acceptable mechanism for reaching another version as long as the method used to set.       the preferences is accessibility supported..    . See Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions. . content (Web content). . . information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions.    . . context-sensitive help. . help text that provides information related to the function currently being performed.

L2 is the relative luminance of the darker of the colors..       . . NoteContrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).. NoteBecause authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered.       (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be.       evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off..    . NoteFor the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect.       to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no.       background color is specified, then white is assumed..    . NoteBackground color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered.       in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text.       color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot.       be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text.       color is specified when a background color is specified..    . NoteWhen there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be.       used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border.       around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that.       fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background..    . NoteWCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that.       an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not.       consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except.       where caused by authors' code..    . . correct reading sequence. . any sequence where words and paragraphs are presented in an order that does not change.       the meaning of the content.    . .

This unit is density-independent, and distinct from actual hardware pixels present.       in a display. User agents and operating systems should ensure that a CSS pixel is.       set as closely as possible to the CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 reference pixel [css3-values], which takes into account the physical dimensions of the display.       and the assumed viewing distance (factors that cannot be determined by content authors)..    . . down-event. . platform event that occurs  when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is depressed. The down-event may have different names on different platforms, such as \"touchstart\" or \"mousedown\".. . emergency. . a sudden, unexpected situation or occurrence that requires immediate action to preserve.       health, safety, or property.    . . essential. . if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content,.       and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform.    . . extended audio description. . audio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the video so that there is time to add additional description.    . NoteThis technique is only used when the sense of the video would be lost without the additional audio description and the pauses between dialogue/narration are too short..    . . flash. . a pair of opposing changes in relative luminance that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency.       range.    . NoteSee general flash and red flash thresholds for information about types of flash that are not allowed..    . NoteSee also blinking..    . . functionality. . processes and outcomes achievable through user action.    . . general flash and red flash thresholds. . a flash or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content passes) if any of the following are true:.    . . there are no more than three general flashes and / or no more than three red flashes within any one-second period; or.       . the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total.          of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10.          degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance.       . . where:. . A general flash is defined as a pair of opposing changes in relative luminance of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance where the relative luminance of.          the darker image is below 0.80; and where \"a pair of opposing changes\" is an increase.          followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and.       . A red flash is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red.       . . Exception: Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating.       checkerboard pattern with \"squares\" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical.       viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds..    . NoteFor general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on.       the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide.       a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing.       distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). (Higher resolutions displays.       showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is.       lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.).    . NoteA transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for.       red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or.       relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists.       of two opposing transitions..    . NoteThe current working definition in the field for \"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red\" is where, for either or both states involved in each transition, R/(R+ G + B) >=.       0.8, and the change in the value of (R-G-B)x320 is > 20 (negative values of (R-G-B)x320.       are set to zero) for both transitions. R, G, B values range from 0-1 as specified.       in \u201crelative luminance\u201d definition. [HARDING-BINNIE].    . NoteTools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However,.       no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal.       to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above)..    . . human language. . language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate.       with humans.    . NoteSee also sign language..    . . idiom. . phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from the meaning of the individual words and.       the specific words cannot be changed without losing the meaning.    . Noteidioms cannot be translated directly, word for word, without losing their (cultural.       or language-dependent) meaning..    . In English, \"spilling the beans\" means \"revealing a secret.\" However, \"knocking over.       the beans\" or \"spilling the vegetables\" does not mean the same thing..    . In Japanese, the phrase \"\u3055\u3058\u3092\u6295\u3052\u308b\" literally translates into \"he throws a spoon,\" but it means that there is nothing.       he can do and finally he gives up..    . In Dutch, \"Hij ging met de kippen op stok\" literally translates into \"He went to roost with the chickens,\" but it means that.       he went to bed early..    . . image of text. . text that has been rendered in a non-text form (e.g., an image) in order to achieve.       a particular visual effect.    . NoteThis does not include text that is part of a picture that contains significant other visual content..    . A person's name on a nametag in a photograph.. . informative. . for information purposes and not required for conformance. NoteContent required for conformance is referred to as \"normative.\". . input error. . information provided by the user that is not accepted. Note. This includes:. . Information that is required by the Web page but omitted by the user.       . Information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data.          format or values.       . . . . jargon. . words used in a particular way by people in a particular field. The word StickyKeys is jargon from the field of assistive technology/accessibility.. . keyboard interface. . interface used by software to obtain keystroke input. NoteA keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the.       native technology does not contain a keyboard..    . NoteA touchscreen PDA has a keyboard interface built into its operating system as well.       as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface.       to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications.       that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text.       applications with \"keyboard emulation\" functionality..    . NoteOperation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated.       mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard.       interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface,.       not through its keyboard interface..    . . keyboard shortcut. . alternative means of triggering an action by the pressing of one or more keys. . label. . text or other component with a text alternative that is presented to a user to identify a component within Web content. NoteA label is presented to all users whereas the name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases.       the name and the label are the same..    . NoteThe term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.. . large scale (text). . . with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size.       for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts.    . NoteFonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that.       reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower.       contrast levels..    . NoteFont size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing.       that may be done by a user..    . NoteThe actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined.       size and the user's display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text.       fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150%.       of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors.       would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in.       relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display..       The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font.       metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who.       have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings..    . NoteWhen using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major.       browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If.       a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would.       be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from.       the default sizes in a similar fashion..    . NoteThe 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large.       print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK.       languages, the \"equivalent\" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those.       languages and the next larger standard large print size..    . . legal commitments. . transactions where the person incurs a legally binding obligation or benefit. A marriage license, a stock trade (financial and legal), a will, a loan, adoption,.       signing up for the army, a contract of any type, etc..    . . link purpose. . nature of the result obtained by activating a hyperlink. . live. . information captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with.       no more than a broadcast delay.    . NoteA broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order.       to give the broadcaster time to cue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient.       to allow significant editing..    . NoteIf information is completely computer generated, it is not live.. . lower secondary education level. . the two or three year period of education that begins after completion of six years.       of school and ends nine years after the beginning of primary education. NoteThis definition is based on the International Standard Classification of Education.       [UNESCO]..    . . mechanism. . process or technique for achieving a result.    . NoteThe mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content, or may be relied upon to be provided by either the platform or by user agents, including assistive technologies..    . NoteThe mechanism needs to meet all success criteria for the conformance level claimed.. . media alternative for text. . media that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly.       or via text alternatives).    . NoteA media alternative for text is provided for those who benefit from alternate representations.       of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language.       video), or audio-video..    . . motion animation. . addition of steps between conditions to create the illusion of movement or to give a sense of a smooth transition. For example, an element which moves into place or changes size while appearing is considered to be animated. An element which appears instantly without transitioning is not using animation. Motion animation does not include changes of color, blurring or opacity.. . name. . text by which software can identify a component within Web content to the user. NoteThe name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a label is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are.       the same..    . NoteThis is unrelated to the name attribute in HTML.. . navigated sequentially. . navigated in the order defined for advancing focus (from one element to the next).       using a keyboard interface. . non-text content. . any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language. NoteThis includes ASCII Art (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, leetspeak (which uses character substitution),.       and images representing text.    . . normative. . required for conformance. NoteOne may conform in a variety of well-defined ways to this document.. NoteContent identified as \"informative\" or \"non-normative\" is never required for conformance.. . on a full-screen window. . on the most common sized desktop/laptop display with the viewport maximized. NoteSince people generally keep their computers for several years, it is best not to rely.       on the latest desktop/laptop display resolutions but to consider the common desktop/laptop.       display resolutions over the course of several years when making this evaluation..    . . paused. . stopped by user request and not resumed until requested by user. . pointer input. . input device that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen,.       such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact.    .

NoteThis definition is based on the International Standard Classification of Education.       [UNESCO]..    . . process. . series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity. Successful use of a series of Web pages on a shopping site requires users to view.       alternative products, prices and offers, select products, submit an order, provide.       shipping information and provide payment information..    . An account registration page requires successful completion of a Turing test before.       the registration form can be accessed..    . . programmatically determined (programmatically determinable). . . determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different.       user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities.    . NoteDetermined in a markup language from elements and attributes that are accessed directly.       by commonly available assistive technology..    . NoteDetermined from technology-specific data structures in a non-markup language and exposed.       to assistive technology via an accessibility API that is supported by commonly available.       assistive technology..    . . programmatically determined link context. . additional information that can be programmatically determined from relationships with a link, combined with the link text, and presented to users in different modalities.    . In HTML, information that is programmatically determinable from a link in English.       includes text that is in the same paragraph, list, or table cell as the link or in.       a table header cell that is associated with the table cell that contains the link..    . NoteSince screen readers interpret punctuation, they can also provide the context from.       the current sentence, when the focus is on a link in that sentence..    . . programmatically set. . set by software using methods that are supported by user agents, including assistive.       technologies.    . . pure decoration. . serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality. NoteText is only purely decorative if the words can be rearranged or substituted without.       changing their purpose..    . The cover page of a dictionary has random words in very light text in the background.. . real-time event. . event that a) occurs at the same time as the viewing and b) is not completely generated.       by the content.    . A Webcast of a live performance (occurs at the same time as the viewing and is not.       prerecorded)..    . An on-line auction with people bidding (occurs at the same time as the viewing).. Live humans interacting in a virtual world using avatars (is not completely generated.       by the content and occurs at the same time as the viewing)..    . . region. . perceivable, programmatically determined section of content. NoteIn HTML, any area designated with a landmark role would be a region.. . relationships. . meaningful associations between distinct pieces of content. . relative luminance. . the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest.       black and 1 for lightest white.    . Note. For the sRGB colorspace, the relative luminance of a color is defined as L = 0.2126.       * R + 0.7152 * G + 0.0722 * B where R, G and B are defined as:.    . . if RsRGB <= 0.03928 then R = RsRGB/12.92 else R = ((RsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4.       . if GsRGB <= 0.03928 then G = GsRGB/12.92 else G = ((GsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4.       . if BsRGB <= 0.03928 then B = BsRGB/12.92 else B = ((BsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4.       . . and RsRGB, GsRGB, and BsRGB are defined as:. .

NoteAlmost all systems used today to view Web content assume sRGB encoding. Unless it.       is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content,.       authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3..    . NoteIf dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors.       that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered.       should be used (average R, average G, and average B)..    .

A submit \"search\" button on one Web page and a \"find\" button on another Web page may.       both have a field to enter a term and list topics in the Web site related to the term.       submitted. In this case, they would have the same functionality but would not be labeled.       consistently..    . . same relative order. . same position relative to other items. NoteItems are considered to be in the same relative order even if other items are inserted.       or removed from the original order. For example, expanding navigation menus may insert.       an additional level of detail or a secondary navigation section may be inserted into.       the reading order..    . . satisfies a success criterion. . the success criterion does not evaluate to 'false' when applied to the page. . section. . a self-contained portion of written content that deals with one or more related topics.       or thoughts.    .

Examples include a publication which is split across multiple Web pages, where each page contains.       one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically.       a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the.       full set of pages..    . NoteDifferent language versions would be considered different sets of Web pages.. . sign language. . a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions,.       or body positions to convey meaning.    . . sign language interpretation. . translation of one language, generally a spoken language, into a sign language.

Style properties can have several origins:. . User agent default styles: The default style property values applied in the absence of any author or user styles. Some web content technologies specify a default rendering, others do not;. Author styles: Style property values that are set by the author as part of the content (e.g. in-line styles, author style. sheets);. User styles: Style property values that are set by the user (e.g. via user agent interface settings, user style sheets). . . supplemental content. . additional content that illustrates or clarifies the primary content.    .

NoteIf two or more touch targets are overlapping, the overlapping area should not be included in the measurement of the target size, except when the overlapping targets perform the same action or open the same page.. . technology (Web content). . . mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents. NoteAs used in these guidelines \"Web Technology\" and the word \"technology\" (when used.       alone) both refer to Web Content Technologies..    . NoteWeb content technologies may include markup languages, data formats, or programming.       languages that authors may use alone or in combination to create end-user experiences.       that range from static Web pages to synchronized media presentations to dynamic Web.       applications..    .

Text that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content..       Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined.       from the non-text content..    . An image of a chart is described in text in the paragraph after the chart. The short.       text alternative for the chart indicates that a description follows..    .

The up-event may have different names on different platforms, such as \"touchend\" or \"mouseup\".. . used in an unusual or restricted way. . words used in such a way that requires users to know exactly which definition to apply.       in order to understand the content correctly.    . The term \"gig\" means something different if it occurs in a discussion of music concerts.       than it does in article about computer hard drive space, but the appropriate definition.       can be determined from context. By contrast, the word \"text\" is used in a very specific.       way in WCAG 2.1, so a definition is supplied in the glossary..    . . user agent. . any software that retrieves and presents Web content for users. Web browsers, media players, plug-ins, and other programs \u2014 including assistive technologies \u2014 that help in retrieving, rendering, and interacting with Web content..    . . user-controllable. . data that is intended to be accessed by users. NoteThis does not refer to such things as Internet logs and search engine monitoring data.. Name and address fields for a user's account.. . user interface component. . a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct.       function.    . NoteMultiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element..       Components here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user.       perceives as separate controls..    . NoteUser interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated.       by scripts..    . NoteWhat is meant by \"component\" or \"user interface component\" here is also sometimes.       called \"user interface element\"..    . An applet has a \"control\" that can be used to move through content by line or page.       or random access. Since each of these would need to have a name and be settable independently,.       they would each be a \"user interface component.\".    . . user inactivity. . any continuous period of time where no user actions occur. The method of tracking will be determined by the web site or application.. . video. . the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images. NoteVideo can be made up of animated or photographic images, or both.. . video-only. . a time-based presentation that contains only video (no audio and no interaction).    . . viewport. . object in which the user agent presents content. NoteThe user agent presents content through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames,.       loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport.       (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts,.       menus, and alerts are not viewports..    .

Web page. . a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources.       that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent. NoteAlthough any \"other resources\" would be rendered together with the primary resource,.       they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other..    . NoteFor the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be \"non-embedded\".       within the scope of conformance to be considered a Web page..    . A Web resource including all embedded images and media.. A Web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX).

The terms below are not keywords that must be used, but instead represent purposes that must be captured in the taxonomy adopted by a webpage. Where applicable, authors mark up controls with the chosen taxonomy to indicate the semantic purpose.
