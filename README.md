# AI Text Tools

A browser extension bridging browsers to large language models, for programmatic text manipulation.

### TODO

- [ ] Option to use clipboard text
- [ ] Get it working on Google Docs (possibly with clipboard hack?)
- [ ] Keybinding to trigger extension
- [ ] Option to seamlessly replace selected text
- [ ] Library of built-in prompts to use for text editing tasks
- [ ] LLM embeddings search on websites, like OAI demo(?)
- [ ] Options for which model to use, number of tokens, etc.
