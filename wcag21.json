      "section_text": "Abstract\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.\nWCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.\nWCAG 2.1 extends Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [WCAG20], which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. The WG intends that for policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The publication of WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. While WCAG 2.0 remains a W3C Recommendation, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.1 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating Web accessibility policies.\n",

Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.\nWCAG 2.1 is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for Web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.1 builds on WCAG 2.0 [WCAG20], which in turn built on WCAG 1.0 [WAI-WEBCONTENT] and is designed to apply broadly to different Web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview.\nSignificant challenges were encountered in defining additional criteria to address cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, including a short timeline for development as well as challenges in reaching consensus on testability, implementability, and international considerations of proposals. Work will carry on in this area in future versions of WCAG. We encourage authors to refer to our supplemental guidance on improving inclusion for people with disabilities, including learning and cognitive disabilities, people with low-vision, and more.\nWeb accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible Web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in Web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of Web development and interaction work together, see:\n\nEssential Components of Web Accessibility\nUser Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Overview\nAuthoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview\n\n\n\n0.2 WCAG 2 Layers of Guidance\u00a7\nThe individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include Web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall principles, general guidelines, testable success criteria and a rich collection of sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and documented common failures with examples, resource links and code.\n\n\nPrinciples - At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for Web accessibility: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. See also Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility.\n\n\nGuidelines - Under the principles are guidelines. The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.\n\n\nSuccess Criteria - For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.0 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in Understanding Levels of Conformance.\n\n\nSufficient and Advisory Techniques - For each of the guidelines and success criteria in the WCAG 2.0 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of techniques. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are sufficient for meeting the success criteria and those that are advisory. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.0.\n\n\nAll of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users.\nNote that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive language and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that Web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. Metadata may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs. \n\n\n0.3 WCAG 2.1 Supporting Documents\u00a7\nThe WCAG 2.0 document is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical standard. Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on the WCAG 2.0 document and address other important purposes, including the ability to be updated to describe how WCAG would be applied with new technologies. Supporting documents include: \n\n\nHow to Meet WCAG 2.1 - A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2.1 that includes all of the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques for authors to use as they are developing and evaluating Web content. This includes content from WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 and can be filtered in many ways to help authors focus on relevant content.\n\n\nUnderstanding WCAG 2.1 - A guide to understanding and implementing WCAG 2.1. There is a short \"Understanding\" document for each guideline and success criterion in WCAG 2.1 as well as key topics.\n\n\nTechniques for WCAG 2.1 - A collection of techniques and common failures, each in a separate document that includes a description, examples, code and tests.\n\n\nThe WCAG Documents - A diagram and description of how the technical documents are related and linked.\n\n\nSee Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview for a description of the WCAG 2.0 supporting material, including education resources related to WCAG 2. Additional resources covering topics such as the business case for Web accessibility, planning implementation to improve the accessibility of Web sites, and accessibility policies are listed in WAI Resources.\n\n\n0.4 Requirements for WCAG 2.1\u00a7\nWCAG 2.1 meets a set of requirements for WCAG 2.1 which, in turn, inherit requirements from WCAG 2.0. Requirements structure the overall framework of guidelines and ensure backwards compatibility. The Working Group also used a less formal set of acceptance criteria for success criteria, to help ensure success criteria are similar in style and quality to those in WCAG 2.0. These requirements constrained what could be included in WCAG 2.1. This constraint was important to preserve its nature as a dot-release of WCAG 2.\n\n\n0.5 Comparison with WCAG 2.0\u00a7\nWCAG 2.1 was initiated with the goal to improve accessibility guidance for three major groups: users with cognitive or learning disabilities, users with low vision, and users with disabilities on mobile devices. Many ways to meet these needs were proposed and evaluated, and a set of these were refined by the Working Group. Structural requirements inherited from WCAG 2.0, clarity and impact of proposals, and timeline led to the final set of success criteria included in this version. The Working Group considers that WCAG 2.1 incrementally advances web content accessibility guidance for all these areas, but underscores that not all user needs are met by these guidelines.\nWCAG 2.1 builds on and is backwards compatible with WCAG 2.0, meaning web pages that conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0. Authors that are required by policy to conform with WCAG 2.0 will be able to update content to WCAG 2.1 without losing conformance with WCAG 2.0. Authors following both sets of guidelines should be aware of the following differences:\n\n0.5.1 New Features in WCAG 2.1\u00a7\nWCAG 2.1 extends WCAG 2.0 by adding new success criteria, definitions to support them, guidelines to organize the additions, and a couple additions to the conformance section. This additive approach helps to make it clear that sites which conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0, thereby meeting conformance obligations that are specific to WCAG 2.0. The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group recommends that sites adopt WCAG 2.1 as their new conformance target, even if formal obligations mention WCAG 2.0, to provide improved accessibility and to anticipate future policy changes.\nThe following Success Criteria are new in WCAG 2.1:\n\n1.3.4 Orientation (AA)\n1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA)\n1.3.6 Identify Purpose (AAA)\n1.4.10 Reflow (AA)\n1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast (AA)\n1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA)\n1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AA)\n2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A)\n2.2.6 Timeouts (AAA)\n2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA)\n2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A)\n2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A)\n2.5.3 Label in Name (A)\n2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A)\n2.5.5 Target Size (AAA)\n2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms (AAA)\n4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)\n\nMany of these success criteria reference new terms that have also been added to the glossary and form part of the normative requirements of the success criteria. \nIn the Conformance section, a third note about page variants has been added to Full Pages, and an option for machine-readable metadata added to Optional Components of a Conformance Claim.\n\n\n0.5.2 Numbering in WCAG 2.1\u00a7\nIn order to avoid confusion for implementers for whom backwards compatibility to WCAG 2.0 is important, new success criteria in WCAG 2.1 have been appended to the end of the set of success criteria within their guideline. This avoids the need to change the section number of success criteria from WCAG 2.0, which would be caused by inserting new success critera between existing success ccriteria in the guideline, but it means success criteria in each guideline are no longer grouped by conformance level. The order of success criteria within each guideline does not imply information about conformance level; only the conformance level indicator (A / AA / AAA) on the success criterion itself indicates this. The WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference provides ways to view success criteria grouped by conformance level, along with many other filter and sort options.\n\n\n0.5.3 Conformance to WCAG 2.1\u00a7\nWCAG 2.1 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0 with a couple additions, which is described in the Conformance section. It is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0, while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web. \n\n\n\n0.6 Later Versions of Accessibility Guidelines\u00a7\nIn parallel with WCAG 2.1, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is developing another major version of accessibility guidelines. The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The work follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.1 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0. The Working Group might also develop additional interim versions, continuing with WCAG 2.2, on a similar short timeline to provide additional support while the major version is completed. \n\n",

The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group recommends that sites adopt WCAG 2.1 as their new conformance target, even if formal obligations mention WCAG 2.0, to provide improved accessibility and to anticipate future policy changes.\nThe following Success Criteria are new in WCAG 2.1:\n\n1.3.4 Orientation (AA)\n1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA)\n1.3.6 Identify Purpose (AAA)\n1.4.10 Reflow (AA)\n1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast (AA)\n1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA)\n1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AA)\n2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A)\n2.2.6 Timeouts (AAA)\n2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA)\n2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A)\n2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A)\n2.5.3 Label in Name (A)\n2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A)\n2.5.5 Target Size (AAA)\n2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms (AAA)\n4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)\n\nMany of these success criteria reference new terms that have also been added to the glossary and form part of the normative requirements of the success criteria. \nIn the Conformance section, a third note about page variants has been added to Full Pages, and an option for machine-readable metadata added to Optional Components of a Conformance Claim.\n",

This avoids the need to change the section number of success criteria from WCAG 2.0, which would be caused by inserting new success critera between existing success ccriteria in the guideline, but it means success criteria in each guideline are no longer grouped by conformance level. The order of success criteria within each guideline does not imply information about conformance level; only the conformance level indicator (A / AA / AAA) on the success criterion itself indicates this. The WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference provides ways to view success criteria grouped by conformance level, along with many other filter and sort options.\n",

The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The work follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.1 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0. The Working Group might also develop additional interim versions, continuing with WCAG 2.2, on a similar short timeline to provide additional support while the major version is completed. \n",

      "section_text": "\n5. Conformance\u00a7\nThis section lists requirements for conformance to WCAG 2.1. It also gives information about how to make conformance claims, which are optional. Finally, it describes what it means to be accessibility supported, since only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies can be relied upon for conformance. Understanding Conformance includes further explanation of the accessibility-supported concept.\n\n5.1 Interpreting Normative Requirements\u00a7\nThe main content of WCAG 2.1 is normative and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as \"non-normative\", diagrams, examples, and notes are informative (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.\nThe key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, NOT RECOMMENDED, RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\n\n5.2 Conformance Requirements\u00a7\nIn order for a Web page to conform to WCAG 2.1, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:\n\n5.2.1 Conformance Level\u00a7\nOne of the following levels of conformance is met in full.\n\nFor Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the Web page\nsatisfies all the Level A Success Criteria, or a conforming alternate version is provided.\nFor Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.\nFor Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.\n\nNoteAlthough conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.\nNoteIt is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.\n\n\n5.2.2 Full pages\u00a7\nConformance (and conformance level) is for full Web page(s) only, and cannot be achieved if part of a Web page is excluded.\nNoteFor the purpose of determining conformance, alternatives to part of a page's content are considered part of the page when the alternatives can be obtained directly from the page, e.g., a long description or an alternative presentation of a video.\nNoteAuthors of Web pages that cannot conform due to content outside of the author's control may consider a Statement of Partial Conformance.\nNoteNew A full page includes each variation of the page that is automatically presented by the page for various screen sizes (e.g. variations in a responsive Web page). Each of these variations needs to conform (or needs to have a conforming alternate version) in order for the entire page to conform.\n\n\n5.2.3 Complete processes\u00a7\nWhen a Web page is one of a series of Web pages presenting a process (i.e., a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity), all Web pages in the process conform at the specified level or better. (Conformance is not possible at a particular level if any page in the process does not conform at that level or better.)\nAn online store has a series of pages that are used to select and purchase products. All pages in the series from start to finish (checkout) conform in order for any page that is part of the process to conform.\n\n\n5.2.4 Only Accessibility-Supported Ways of Using Technologies\u00a7\nOnly accessibility-supported ways of using technologies are relied upon to satisfy the success criteria. Any information or functionality that is provided in a way that is not accessibility supported is also available in a way that is accessibility supported. (See Understanding accessibility support.)\n\n\n5.2.5 Non-Interference\u00a7\nIf  technologies  are used in a way that is not accessibility supported, or if they are used in a non-conforming way, then they do not block the ability of users to access the rest of the page. In addition, the Web page as a whole continues to meet the conformance requirements under each of the following conditions:\n\nwhen any technology that is not relied upon is turned on in a user agent,\nwhen any technology that is not relied upon is turned off in a user agent, and\nwhen any technology that is not relied upon is not supported by a user agent\n\nIn addition, the following success criteria apply to all content on the page, including content that is not otherwise relied upon to meet conformance, because failure to meet them could interfere with any use of the page:\n\n1.4.2 - Audio Control,\n2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap,\n2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below Threshold, and\n2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide.\n\nNoteIf a page cannot conform (for example, a conformance test page or an example page), it cannot be included in the scope of conformance or in a conformance claim.\nFor more information, including examples, see Understanding Conformance Requirements.\n\n\n\n5.3 Conformance Claims (Optional) \u00a7\nConformance is defined only for Web pages. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one page, a series of pages, or multiple related Web pages.\n\n5.3.1 Required Components of a Conformance Claim\u00a7\nConformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 2.1 without making a claim. However, if a conformance claim is made, then the conformance claim must include the following information:\n\nDate of the claim\nGuidelines title, version and URI  \"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 at https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\" In WCAG 2.0 this was a dated URI, which may need to be adjusted when this becomes a Rec.\nConformance level satisfied: (Level A, AA or AAA)\n\nA concise description of the Web pages, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including whether subdomains are included in the claim.\nNoteThe Web pages may be described by list or by an expression that describes all of the URIs included in the claim.\nNoteWeb-based products that do not have a URI prior to installation on the customer's Web site may have a statement that the product would conform when installed.\n\nA list of the \nWeb content technologies\nrelied upon.\n\nNoteIf a conformance logo is used, it would constitute a claim and must be accompanied by the required components of a conformance claim listed above.\n\n\n5.3.2 Optional Components of a Conformance Claim \u00a7\nIn addition to the required components of a conformance claim above, consider providing additional information to assist users. Recommended additional information includes:\n\nA list of success criteria beyond the level of conformance claimed that have been met. This information should be provided in a form that users can use, preferably machine-readable metadata.\nA list of the specific technologies that are \" used but not relied upon.\"\nA list of user agents, including assistive technologies that were used to test the content.\nA list of specific accessibility characteristics of the content, provided in machine-readable metadata.\nInformation about any additional steps taken that go beyond the success criteria to enhance accessibility.\nA machine-readable metadata version of the list of specific technologies that are relied upon.\nA machine-readable metadata version of the conformance claim.\n\nNoteRefer to Understanding Conformance Claims for more information and example conformance claims.\nNoteRefer to Understanding Metadata for more information about the use of metadata in conformance claims.\n\n\n\n5.4 Statement of Partial Conformance - Third Party Content\u00a7\nSometimes, Web pages are created that will later have additional content added to them. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.\nIn these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:\n\n\nA determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;\nOR\n\n\nA \"statement of partial conformance\" may be made that the page does not conform, but could conform if certain parts were removed. The form of that statement would be, \"This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.1 at level X if the following parts from uncontrolled sources were removed.\" In addition, the following would also be true of uncontrolled content that is described in the statement of partial conformance:\n\nIt is not content that is under the author's control.\nIt is described in a way that users can identify (e.g., they cannot be described as \"all parts that we do not control\" unless they are clearly marked as such.)\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Statement of Partial Conformance - Language\u00a7\nA \"statement of partial conformance due to language\" may be made when the page does not conform, but would conform if accessibility support existed for (all of) the language(s) used on the page. The form of that statement would be, \"This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.1 at level X if accessibility support existed for the following language(s):\"\n\n",

For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.\nIn these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:\n\n\nA determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;\nOR\n\n\nA \"statement of partial conformance\" may be made that the page does not conform, but could conform if certain parts were removed. The form of that statement would be, \"This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.1 at level X if the following parts from uncontrolled sources were removed.\" In addition, the following would also be true of uncontrolled content that is described in the statement of partial conformance:\n\nIt is not content that is under the author's control.\nIt is described in a way that users can identify (e.g., they cannot be described as \"all parts that we do not control\" unless they are clearly marked as such.)\n\n\n\n",

This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability\n            with users' assistive technology in the human language(s) of the content,\n         \nAND\n\n\nThe Web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are\n               available to users.

(See Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for \"Accessibility Support\".)\n   \nNoteWeb technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long\n      as they are not relied upon and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including Conformance Criterion 4 and Conformance Criterion 5, are met.\n   \nNoteWhen a Web Technology is used in a way that is \"accessibility supported,\" it does not imply that the entire\n      technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including\n      HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if\n      the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to\n      meet WCAG requirements.\n   \nNoteWhen citing Web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported\n      should be specified.\n   \nNoteOne way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported\n      would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported.\n      (See Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses.) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported\n      ways of using Web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in\n      the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web\n      content technologies above.\n   \n\nalternative for time-based media\n\ndocument including correctly sequenced text descriptions of time-based visual and\n      auditory information and providing a means for achieving the outcomes of any time-based\n      interaction\n   \nNoteA screenplay used to create the synchronized media content would meet this definition\n      only if it was corrected to accurately represent the final synchronized media after\n      editing.\n   \n\nambiguous to users in general\n\nthe purpose cannot be determined from the link and all information of the Web page\n      presented to the user simultaneously with the link (i.e., readers without disabilities\n      would not know what a link would do until they activated it)\n   \nThe word guava in the following sentence \"One of the notable exports is guava\" is\n      a link. The link could lead to a definition of guava, a chart listing the quantity\n      of guava exported or a photograph of people harvesting guava. Until the link is activated,\n      all readers are unsure and the person with a disability is not at any disadvantage.\n   \n\nASCII art\n\npicture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the\n      95 printable characters defined by ASCII)\n   \n\nassistive technology (as used in this document)\n\n\nhardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements\n      of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents\n   \nNotefunctionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations\n      (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g.,\n      voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations\n      (e.g., to make tables more accessible).\n   \nNoteAssistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents\n      by using and monitoring APIs.\n   \nNoteThe distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.\n      Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.\n      The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences\n      that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies\n      target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance\n      provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs\n      of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality\n      to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing\n      markup into identifiable bundles.\n   \nAssistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include\n      the following:\n   \n\nscreen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with\n         visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing,\n         color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability\n         of rendered text and images;\n      \nscreen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information\n         through synthesized speech or braille;\n      \ntext-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and\n         learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;\n      \nspeech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;\nalternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities\n         to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single\n         switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);\n      \nalternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities\n         to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.\n      \n\n\naudio\n\nthe technology of sound reproduction\nNoteAudio can be created synthetically (including speech synthesis), recorded from real\n      world sounds, or both.\n   \n\naudio description\n\nnarration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot\n      be understood from the main soundtrack alone\n   \nNoteAudio description of video provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and\n      other visual content.\n   \nNoteIn standard audio description, narration is added during existing pauses in dialogue.\n      (See also extended audio description.)\n   \nNoteWhere all of the video information is already provided in existing audio, no additional audio description is necessary.\n   \nNoteAlso called \"video description\" and \"descriptive narration.\"\n\naudio-only\n\na time-based presentation that contains only audio (no video and no interaction)\n   \n\nblinking\n\nswitch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention\nNoteSee also flash. It is possible for something to be large enough and blink brightly enough at the\n      right frequency to be also classified as a flash.\n   \n\nblocks of text\n\nmore than one sentence of text\n\nCAPTCHA\n\ninitialism for \"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans\n      Apart\"\n   \nNoteCAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an\n      obscured image or audio file.\n   \nNoteA Turing test is any system of tests designed to differentiate a human from a computer.\n      It is named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing. The term was coined by researchers\n      at Carnegie Mellon University.\n   \n\ncaptions\n\nsynchronized visual and/or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content\n   \nNoteCaptions are similar to dialogue-only subtitles except captions convey not only the\n      content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information\n      needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter,\n      speaker identification and location.\n   \nNoteClosed Captions are equivalents that can be turned on and off with some players.\nNoteOpen Captions are any captions that cannot be turned off. For example, if the captions\n      are visual equivalent images of text embedded in video.\n   \nNoteCaptions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.\nNoteIn some countries, captions are called subtitles.\nNoteAudio descriptions can be, but do not need to be, captioned since they are descriptions of information\n      that is already presented visually.\n   \n\nchanges of context\n\nmajor changes in the content of the Web page that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view\n      the entire page simultaneously\n   \nChanges in context include changes of:\n\nuser agent;\n      \nviewport;\n      \nfocus;\ncontent that changes the meaning of the Web page\n\n\nNoteA change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as\n      an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the\n      context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).\n   \nOpening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including\n      anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly\n      re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.\n   \n\nconformance\n\nsatisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification\n\nconforming alternate version\n\nversion that\n\nconforms at the designated level, and\nprovides all of the same information and functionality in the same human language, and\n      \nis as up to date as the non-conforming content, and\n\nfor which at least one of the following is true:\n\nthe conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an accessibility-supported\nmechanism, or\n            \nthe non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version, or\nthe non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides\n               a mechanism to reach the conforming version\n            \n\n\n\nNoteIn this definition, \"can only be reached\" means that there is some mechanism, such\n      as a conditional redirect, that prevents a user from \"reaching\" (loading) the non-conforming\n      page unless the user had just come from the conforming version.\n   \nNoteThe alternate version does not need to be matched page for page with the original\n      (e.g., the conforming alternate version may consist of multiple pages).\n   \nNoteIf multiple language versions are available, then conforming alternate versions are\n      required for each language offered.\n   \nNoteAlternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments\n      or user groups. Each version should be as conformant as possible. One version would\n      need to be fully conformant in order to meet conformance requirement 1.\n   \nNoteThe conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance,\n      or even on the same Web site, as long as it is as freely available as the non-conforming\n      version.\n   \nNoteAlternate versions should not be confused with supplementary content, which support the original page and enhance comprehension.\n   \nNoteSetting user preferences within the content to produce a conforming version is an\n      acceptable mechanism for reaching another version as long as the method used to set\n      the preferences is accessibility supported.\n   \nSee Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions\n\ncontent (Web content)\n\n\ninformation and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions\n   \n\ncontext-sensitive help\n\nhelp text that provides information related to the function currently being performed\nNoteClear labels can act as context-sensitive help.\n\ncontrast ratio\n\n(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where\n\nL1 is the relative luminance of the lighter of the colors, and\n      \nL2 is the relative luminance of the darker of the colors.\n      \n\nNoteContrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).\nNoteBecause authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered\n      (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be\n      evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.\n   \nNoteFor the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect\n      to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no\n      background color is specified, then white is assumed.\n   \nNoteBackground color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered\n      in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text\n      color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot\n      be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text\n      color is specified when a background color is specified.\n   \nNoteWhen there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be\n      used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border\n      around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that\n      fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.\n   \nNoteWCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that\n      an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not\n      consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except\n      where caused by authors' code.\n   \n\ncorrect reading sequence\n\nany sequence where words and paragraphs are presented in an order that does not change\n      the meaning of the content\n   \n\nCSS pixel\n\nvisual angle of about 0.0213 degrees\nA CSS pixel is the canonical unit of measure for all lengths and measurements in CSS.\n      This unit is density-independent, and distinct from actual hardware pixels present\n      in a display. User agents and operating systems should ensure that a CSS pixel is\n      set as closely as possible to the CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 reference pixel [css3-values], which takes into account the physical dimensions of the display\n      and the assumed viewing distance (factors that cannot be determined by content authors).\n   \n\ndown-event\n\nplatform event that occurs  when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is depressed\nThe down-event may have different names on different platforms, such as \"touchstart\" or \"mousedown\".\n\nemergency\n\na sudden, unexpected situation or occurrence that requires immediate action to preserve\n      health, safety, or property\n   \n\nessential\n\nif removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content,\n      and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform\n   \n\nextended audio description\n\naudio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the video so that there is time to add additional description\n   \nNoteThis technique is only used when the sense of the video would be lost without the additional audio description and the pauses between dialogue/narration are too short.\n   \n\nflash\n\na pair of opposing changes in relative luminance that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency\n      range\n   \nNoteSee general flash and red flash thresholds for information about types of flash that are not allowed.\n   \nNoteSee also blinking.\n   \n\nfunctionality\n\nprocesses and outcomes achievable through user action\n   \n\ngeneral flash and red flash thresholds\n\na flash or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content passes) if any of the following are true:\n   \n\nthere are no more than three general flashes and / or no more than three red flashes within any one-second period; or\n      \nthe combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total\n         of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10\n         degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance\n      \n\nwhere:\n\nA general flash is defined as a pair of opposing changes in relative luminance of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance where the relative luminance of\n         the darker image is below 0.80; and where \"a pair of opposing changes\" is an increase\n         followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and\n      \nA red flash is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red\n      \n\nException: Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating\n      checkerboard pattern with \"squares\" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical\n      viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.\n   \nNoteFor general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on\n      the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide\n      a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing\n      distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). (Higher resolutions displays\n      showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is\n      lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.)\n   \nNoteA transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for\n      red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or\n      relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists\n      of two opposing transitions.\n   \nNoteThe current working definition in the field for \"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red\" is where, for either or both states involved in each transition, R/(R+ G + B) >=\n      0.8, and the change in the value of (R-G-B)x320 is > 20 (negative values of (R-G-B)x320\n      are set to zero) for both transitions. R, G, B values range from 0-1 as specified\n      in \u201crelative luminance\u201d definition. [HARDING-BINNIE]\n   \nNoteTools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However,\n      no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal\n      to 3 flashes in any one second.

Applications on the PDA can use the interface\n      to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications\n      that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text\n      applications with \"keyboard emulation\" functionality.\n   \nNoteOperation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated\n      mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard\n      interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface,\n      not through its keyboard interface.\n   \n\nkeyboard shortcut\n\nalternative means of triggering an action by the pressing of one or more keys\n\nlabel\n\ntext or other component with a text alternative that is presented to a user to identify a component within Web content\nNoteA label is presented to all users whereas the name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases\n      the name and the label are the same.\n   \nNoteThe term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.\n\nlarge scale (text)\n\n\nwith at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size\n      for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts\n   \nNoteFonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that\n      reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower\n      contrast levels.\n   \nNoteFont size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing\n      that may be done by a user.\n   \nNoteThe actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined\n      size and the user's display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text\n      fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150%\n      of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors\n      would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in\n      relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display.\n      The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font\n      metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who\n      have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.\n   \nNoteWhen using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major\n      browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If\n      a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would\n      be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from\n      the default sizes in a similar fashion.\n   \nNoteThe 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large\n      print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK\n      languages, the \"equivalent\" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those\n      languages and the next larger standard large print size.\n   \n\nlegal commitments\n\ntransactions where the person incurs a legally binding obligation or benefit\nA marriage license, a stock trade (financial and legal), a will, a loan, adoption,\n      signing up for the army, a contract of any type, etc.\n   \n\nlink purpose\n\nnature of the result obtained by activating a hyperlink\n\nlive\n\ninformation captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with\n      no more than a broadcast delay\n   \nNoteA broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order\n      to give the broadcaster time to cue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient\n      to allow significant editing.\n   \nNoteIf information is completely computer generated, it is not live.\n\nlower secondary education level\n\nthe two or three year period of education that begins after completion of six years\n      of school and ends nine years after the beginning of primary education\nNoteThis definition is based on the International Standard Classification of Education\n      [UNESCO].\n   \n\nmechanism\n\nprocess or technique for achieving a result\n   \nNoteThe mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content, or may be relied upon to be provided by either the platform or by user agents, including assistive technologies.\n   \nNoteThe mechanism needs to meet all success criteria for the conformance level claimed.\n\nmedia alternative for text\n\nmedia that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly\n      or via text alternatives)\n   \nNoteA media alternative for text is provided for those who benefit from alternate representations\n      of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language\n      video), or audio-video.\n   \n\nmotion animation\n\naddition of steps between conditions to create the illusion of movement or to give a sense of a smooth transition\nFor example, an element which moves into place or changes size while appearing is considered to be animated. An element which appears instantly without transitioning is not using animation. Motion animation does not include changes of color, blurring or opacity.\n\nname\n\ntext by which software can identify a component within Web content to the user\nNoteThe name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a label is presented to all users.

determined from relationships with a link, combined with the link text, and presented to users in different modalities\n   \nIn HTML, information that is programmatically determinable from a link in English\n      includes text that is in the same paragraph, list, or table cell as the link or in\n      a table header cell that is associated with the table cell that contains the link.\n

Unless it\n      is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content,\n      authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3.\n   \nNoteIf dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors\n      that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered\n      should be used (average R, average G, and average B).\n   \nNoteTools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing contrast and\n      flash.\n   \nNoteA MathML version of the relative luminance definition is available.\n   \n\nrelied upon (technologies that are)\n\n\nthe content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported\n   \n\nrole\n\ntext or number by which software can identify the function of a component within Web\n      content\n   \nA number that indicates whether an image functions as a hyperlink, command button,\n      or check box.\n   \n\nsame functionality\n\nsame result when used\nA submit \"search\" button on one Web page and a \"find\" button on another Web page may\n      both have a field to enter a term and list topics in the Web site related to the term\n      submitted.
